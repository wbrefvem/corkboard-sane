Youngest age group does 1 lap, 8-10 2 laps, 11-17 3 laps. We would like to close Rampart completely to traffic (between Gunnison& Manchester). All other streets can be as follows: One side of the street will be closed for the racers while the other side will be one-way only at 10mph. Police will man busy intersections (Shelley) and volunteer directional will be at other intersections. \n RUN \u2013 Down Manchester Dr towards Six Forks, about .25 mi down will be turn-around point. \n Our main concern is a safe course that has the least impact on traffic & residents. Another concern is one that is not too technical or hilly so that every child has a pleasant experience. Normally our bike course is a 1.5 mile loop and run course is a .5 mile loop that can be repeated for older age groups (2 or 3 times). If autos are to be on the same road as participants then we separate them with cones and auto traffic is directed at 10 mph. We obviously prefer a course with no auto traffic. We think that this suggested course would be the least impact on the residents with alternative entrances into the neighborhood, and allows them to take other streets and leave these to the racers. The total street closure time would be approximately 2 hours. All residents will be notified of the event in writing and encouraged to volunteer and/or cheer the kids on.",

We use our organic armed federal security officers to create a single access entry point for all pedestrians entering the property. This is a bag check point, screening area, and choke point to identify abnormal and/or suspicious activity. The working dog is in the vicinity to identify ordinance smells. We supplement the creening with an ion sniffer as neccessary. We have a team of assigned personnel to work various emergency egress points in the event a catastrophic emergency occurs. We have designated staging and evacuation area and casualty collection in the public bus parking lot across the street (primary). We man the barriers to deter unauthorized vehicle traffic from entering the route or property. All vehicles must park in a geographically separate parking lot buffered by a inpenetrable wooded area with only one pedestrian access point. Late registration and packet pick-up occurs outside the pedestrian entry point. We conduct multiple rehearsals prior to execution. Our Anti-terrorism director reviews the plan and offers additional risk mitigation measures for our Composite Risk Management Plan in order to reduce risk to improbable levels. All other details of our mitiagtion plan remain \"law enforcement sensitive\" and may be briefed upon request and clearance from the appropriate level of authority.",

If it is less of an impact to traffic at the intrsxn of Edwards Mill and Reedy Creek, I can recertify the route to use the one portion of Greenway that allows the runners to pass beneath Edwards Mill via the access tunnel.

EMS Medical Branch Director, an officer with the Raleigh Police Department, and a NCSHP Communications Specialist.   They will coordinate all emergency communications with medical staff, the police and the race staff, and will also have communications with the PNC Arena. There will be a Komen representative in the command center that will communicate directly with Liz Goslin by radio or cell phone.\n\nWe will have more specific information on what groups will be where (Duke Medicine, WakeMed, etc.) as we get closer to the event. I am happy to provide regular updates regarding our progress.\n\nIf there is a need to evacuate Meredith Campus, the campus has been split into four zones.  Each zone has a team of volunteers led by a designated \"zone captain\" with instructions for where to direct people in each zone. There are secondary and tertiary evacuation routes in in the event that one route becomes unavailable.",

We would prefer the bike portion to take place on the outside part of the street (going counter clockwise) separated by cones, having the opposite traffic limited to 10-15 mph. These streets are residential with speed bumps and golf cart crossings. Every crossing will be manned by a volunteer directional, the first turn by police. We also have signs to warn of a kid race and to proceed at 10 mph, volunteers voicing this as well, along the whole course. We can allow cars from neighborhoods to cross over into the auto traffic lane with assistance of the volunteer/staff directional. \nmap can be found at http://www.kidsintraining.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/KIT-BC-Map-2013.pdf\n",

The course marshalls will go through training prior to the event to know how to handle any safety situations along with being provided a contact and phone number of a staff member for emergencies. We will also have two EMTs at Moore Square throughout the event. In Moore Square we will also have a sizable sound system along with a walking bullhorn to relay any information. Our event will be held if it is raining but not in the event of thunder/lightening. Our event will be cancelled if this is the case and no rain date is provided. We also make sure our event route and space is kept clean by volunteers and course marshalls so participants safe. We do have all participants sign waivers prior to the event though to reiterate the risks of doing a road race.",
