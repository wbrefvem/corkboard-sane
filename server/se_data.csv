 Transition/Finish Line – Swim club parking lot, area closest to Rampart
 BIKE - Clock-wise around neighborhood streets – Rampart, Gunnison, Kimberly, Wimbledon, Shelley, Cranbrook, Rampart (back to transition). Youngest age group does 1 lap, 8-10 2 laps, 11-17 3 laps. We would like to close Rampart completely to traffic (between Gunnison& Manchester). All other streets can be as follows: One side of the street will be closed for the racers while the other side will be one-way only at 10mph. Police will man busy intersections (Shelley) and volunteer directional will be at other intersections. 
 RUN – Down Manchester Dr towards Six Forks, about .25 mi down will be turn-around point. 
 Our main concern is a safe course that has the least impact on traffic & residents. Another concern is one that is not too technical or hilly so that every child has a pleasant experience. Normally our bike course is a 1.5 mile loop and run course is a .5 mile loop that can be repeated for older age groups (2 or 3 times). If autos are to be on the same road as participants then we separate them with cones and auto traffic is directed at 10 mph. We obviously prefer a course with no auto traffic. We think that this suggested course would be the least impact on the residents with alternative entrances into the neighborhood, and allows them to take other streets and leave these to the racers. The total street closure time would be approximately 2 hours.

We use our organic armed federal security officers to create a single access entry point for all pedestrians entering the property. This is a bag check point, screening area, and choke point to identify abnormal and/or suspicious activity. The working dog is in the vicinity to identify ordinance smells.

We have designated staging and evacuation area and casualty collection in the public bus parking lot across the street (primary). We man the barriers to deter unauthorized vehicle traffic from entering the route or property. All vehicles must park in a geographically separate parking lot buffered by a inpenetrable wooded area with only one pedestrian access point. Late registration and packet pick-up occurs outside the pedestrian entry point. We conduct multiple rehearsals prior to execution.

We have a scaled down 22 page document along with full versions- here is a sampling-

Provide emergency response plans for the venue

• Each year, all Event Security staff members attend a training session on Emergency
response/evacuation. Topics addressed in this training include:
o What staff should do when first going on post
o What to do if they see an emergency situation develop
o Who to contact and how (multiple ways are identified)
o Who they will take direction from during an evacuation/response
o What to do when the building is clear
• Should an emergency be declared, an Incident Command Center (ICC) will be established. Those
staffing the ICC include (but not limited to) building management, Raleigh Police, Raleigh Fire, Wake
County Emergency Services, and Event Security and Event Services managers. Multiple locations
have been pre-identified as to where the ICC will be set up. There is a preferred order as to where it
will be located. The location used is ultimately dependent on the specific nature of the incident,
where in the venue it is located, and availability of building services. Both onsite and offsite
locations have been identified.
• The Chain-of-Command has been established (from venue management to local authorities to
individual staff members)
• Emergency Response Teams, including Public Information, Security (Event Security, Event Services,
Law Enforcement, Medical), Facility (Facility Operations and Engineering), and Emergency
Management have been established.
• PNC Arena also has procedures in place for handling event cancellations, including how to handle
‘day-of’ cancellations.

Each course will be differentiated by color.  The 6 and unders will have red signs, crepe paper, balloons, etc.  The 7 - 10 year olds will have orange signs, crepe paper, balloons, etc.  The 11 - 14 age group will have green signs, crepe paper, balloons, etc.  

Safety is our main concern and any help that people can provide (especially cheering) would be fantastic.



Course for each group:
6 and under
swim - 1 -2 lengths (or whatever your child is comfortable doing)
bike -  go through the parking lot to the black path by the playground, go past the playground and toward the tennis courts, continue around the tennis courts and go up the hill back to the pool parking lot  (approx. 1/3 mile).  
run - from the pool, then left onto New Leesville Blvd to the Bluffs entrance; back up New Leesville Blvd to the pool  (approx. 1/3 - 1/2 mile)


7- 10
swim - 4 lengths (or whatever your child is comfortable doing)
bike - go through the parking lot to the black path by the playground, and past the playground and toward the tennis courts.  At the 2nd bridge go left (after you pass the second set of tennis courts) and continue on the black path between the houses of the Glen and the Bluffs until the path dead ends onto N. Exeter.  Go left onto N. Exeter, and then left again onto Ingate Way.  Follow Ingate Way until it intersects N. Exeter (again, toward the entrance of the Glen); and go left onto N. Exeter until it intersects New Leesville Blvd.  At New Leesville Blvd go left and back to the pool parking lot (to the area where your bike was). (approx. 1 mile)
run - from the pool parking lot run up the steps to New Leesville Blvd, go toward the Bluffs, at the entrance of the Bluffs go left onto Crossfield Court and run to the end of the cul-de-sac and back.  From the entrance of the Bluffs go right onto New Leeseville and the finish line is right about the same spot as the sidewalk that leads one down toward the pool.  (Approx. 1 mile)


11 - 14
swim - 8 lengths (or whatever your child is comfortable doing)
bike - go through the parking lot to the black path by the playground, then past the playground and toward the tennis courts.  At the 2nd bridge go left (after you pass the second set of tennis courts) and continue on the black path between the houses of the Glen and the Bluffs until the path dead ends onto N. Exeter.  Go left onto N. Exeter, and then left again onto Ingate Way.  Follow Ingate Way until it intersects N. Exeter (again, which is toward the entrance of the Glen).  Go left onto N.

run - same as the bike route, only the finish line will be right before the entrance of the pool parking lot. (approx. 1 mile)


Leaving and returning to the parking lot for the middle and older kids' biking portion of the race: the kids will leave the parking lot on the side of the median closest to the trees and tennis courts, go by the playground using the black path, ride through the Glen and go left onto New Leesville Blvd.  As they ride down New Leesville Blvd toward the parking lot, they should stay on the right side of the median, closest to the street, and put their bikes back in their area where they were first parked.
